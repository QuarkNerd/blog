    <p>I spend my days developing desktop/tablet/mobile web apps for financial services companies. Unfortunately, most of those are hidden behind pay-walls, but I do like to blog about it.  I also contribute to a number of open source projects including <a href="http://www.propertycross.com">PropertyCross</a>, KnockoutJS, TodoMVC and <a href="https://github.com/chrisprice">more</a>.</p>

A companion piece to my [recent talk at UX Scotland](http://www.scottlogic.com/blog/2013/06/24/ux-scotland.html) and [upcoming talk at UX Cambridge](http://uxcambridge.net/uxc2013/sessions/index.php?session=4) has been published by [.net magazine](http://www.netmagazine.com/features/science-behind-data-visualisation).  It explores some of the principles of visual perception that underpin data visualisation and how they can be used most effectively.

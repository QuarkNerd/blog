<p>Building on the experience and expertise within <a href="http://www.scottlogic.co.uk" >Scott Logic</a>, my colleague, <a href="http://www.scottlogic.co.uk/blog/colin" >Colin Eberhardt</a>, has produced <a href="http://www.scottlogic.co.uk/blog/colin/2011/05/flex-silverlight-html5-time-to-decide/" >an excellent whitepaper</a> considering the three big web technologies at the moment: Flex, Silverlight and HTML5.  </p>
<blockquote><p><em><br />Recent advances in web technologies have resulted in a complex landscape for application<br />developers to navigate. Coupled with the recent boom in new platforms, from desktops, netbooks,<br />smartphones to tablets, making an informed and future proof technology choice is all the more<br />difficult. In this paper we will set technology bias and politics aside to navigate the similarities and<br />differences between Flex, Silverlight and HTML5 and give you the power to decide.</p>
<p>This white-paper is aimed at technical decision makers who are looking to choose the correct<br />technology for web application development.<br /></em></p>

    <p>I'm a designer, developer and speaker working across desktop, web and mobile, with a particular taste for data visualisation.  At Scott Logic, I work primarily with financial services institutions, designing, building and improving their research and analysis tools.  I like to educate coders about the concept of users and artists about the reality of technology, or just rant and rave at whoever will read this blog.</p>

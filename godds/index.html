    <p>I'm a designer and developer working across desktop, web and mobile, with a particular taste for data visualisation.  At Scott Logic, I work primarily with financial services institutions, designing, building and improving their research and analysis tools.  I like to educate coders about the concept of users and artists about the reality of technology, or just rant and rave at whomever will read this blog.</p>
    <p>Come and listen to me talk about <a href="http://www.uxpa-scotland.org/events.php/the-minds-eye-the-science-behind-data-visualisation">the science behind data visualisation</a> in Edinburgh next week, or about <a href="http://html5-it-just-got-real.com/">Designing The Future</a> at the Royal Society in May.</p>

    <p>I'm a designer, developer and speaker working across desktop, web and mobile, with a particular taste for data visualisation.  At Scott Logic, I work primarily with financial services institutions, designing, building and improving their research and analysis tools.  I like to educate coders about the concept of users and artists about the reality of technology, or just rant and rave at whoever will read this blog.</p>
    <p>Come and listen to me talk about <a href="http://www.meetup.com/bristech/events/141728862/">the science behind data visualisation</a> at <a href="http://www.meetup.com/bristech/">Bristech</a> in December.</p>

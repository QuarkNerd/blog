<p>Test test When I started writing automated tests in Protractor, I had never programmed anything before (unless you count learning enough html/css on codecademy to create an incredibly basic, 90â€™s style webpage). Some of the problems I encountered whilst learning protractor were very hard to find on Google, which did make my learning a lot slower than I would have liked. Luckily I work with amazing people who are more than happy to share their knowledge which has saved me countless times, but unfortunately there are many people out there who do not have access to such resources. So, I have decided to create a tutorial which documents as many issues as possible that I encountered whilst learning.</p>

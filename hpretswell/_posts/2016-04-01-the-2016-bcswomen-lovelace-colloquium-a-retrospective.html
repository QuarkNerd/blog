<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a first-timer at the annual </span><a href="http://bcswomen.bcs.org/?chronosly=bcswomen-lovelace-colloquium"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BCSWomen Lovelace Colloquium</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, I wasn’t sure what to expect, but I was keen to attend as many of the day’s presentations as possible, as well as answer whatever questions I could from the female undergraduates hoping to find out more about their career options in software.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We had a lot of different questions directed at us at the Scott Logic </span><a href="http://www.scottlogic.com"></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">stand, from the c.170 STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths) students in the hall, some of whom had travelled from as far north as Aberdeen and as far south as Exeter universities. Many enquired about what we had to offer them as an </span><a href="http://www.scottlogic.com/careers/life-at-scott-logic/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">employer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, how to </span><a href="//smarter.scottlogic.com/careers/landing-your-first-graduate-job"><span style="font-weight: 400;">prepare for an interview</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and whether they’d be able to get a job in software if they aren’t studying </span><a href="//smarter.scottlogic.com/careers/i-dont-have-a-computer-science-degree-can-i-still-work-in-software-development"><span style="font-weight: 400;">computer science</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We also had quite a few approaches from people who said they didn’t want to become developers, and wanted to know what other options there were in the software field.</span></p><h2>So many options</h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I can’t help thinking it’s a shame to get asked this, as it shows there’s </span><a href="//smarter.scottlogic.com/careers/why-the-pushforparity-is-a-slow-burn"><span style="font-weight: 400;">something lacking</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in educational careers advice if you aren’t given more accurate, or at least broader information, about the many paths you can take after uni. Simply Googling isn’t enough to get a really good impression of the number of options there can be. Most undergraduates I spoke with were at an early stage in their studies and career decision-making, so it was nice to feel we were being useful to them.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, I spoke about what I do in my day to day work as a </span><a href="http://www.scottlogic.com/careers/our-people/hannah-newcastle/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tester</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at Scott Logic</span><a href="http://www.scottlogic.com"></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and it was really nice to see people’s interest in </span><a href="//smarter.scottlogic.com/careers/tacklingthemythsaroundasoftwaretestingcareer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">software testing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as it’s a career option a lot of people haven’t really encountered before they enter the world of work. And people seemed generally interested in our </span><a href="http://www.scottlogic.com/careers/graduateprogramme/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">graduate programme</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is great news. It’s nice to think I may end up welcoming some of those I spoke to as colleagues in the future.</span></p><h2>Lots to take in</h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grabbing a few minutes away from our sponsor’s stand, we also had a look around at some of the posters the students had put up for the event. There were a lot of very interesting ones, on topics ranging from the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">gender divide in technology</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and whether </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">video games are a sport,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">machine learning</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">voice-controlled telepresence robots</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. My personal favourite was on </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">software testing - a myth or priority</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Talking to the student who wrote this, we discussed </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">some of the pitfalls testers encounter, how working as a team with developers can aid in testing, and a tester’s role in getting a good quality final product out.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I also managed to get to three of the presentations, one about </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">open source intelligence</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, one on </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">technology for social good</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and another about </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">the brain computer interface</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. All of these were dynamic and engaging presentations. The </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">open source intelligence</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> presentation was scary to say the least; the presenter showed us how within half an hour, she was able to collect great amounts of information on one individual person: where she worked, where she lived, where her family lived and where her boyfriend lived and worked. It showed that whatever we put on the internet is out there for whoever wants to see it, and that is quite unsettling if you think about that information getting into the wrong hands.</span></p><h2>Together we stand</h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While my colleague John took questions as part of a panel at the end of the day, I reflected on what was all in all, a very good day. We’re already signed up to sponsor next year’s 10th annual colloquium and I’m proud we remain committed to our involvement in the event. I hope that from a Scott Logic and a recruitment perspective we were both able to give assurance to the women in attendance that there is very much a career to be had for them in tech should they wish to pursue it, and meeting so many like-minded and enthusiastic women was fantastic.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, as an industry moving forward, I feel events like this should include more men. After all, the issue these events try to address is the exclusion of, or unfair disadvantages for women when it comes to working in technology. There’s a danger that by having women-only groups and events, we create a bigger divide rather than minimising it, and this can sour young impressionable people towards working in STEM. We must be careful or risk creating an impression for women and girls that there’s an us and them culture in STEM, where females must stick together because they </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">will</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> be discriminated against. This simply isn’t the case, and the idea is enough to put anyone off a career path into STEM. All of us as women, alongside our male colleagues, need to collaborate to tackle this issue </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">together</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It’s an issue that in the end affects all of us, not just women. </span></p><strong><br><span style="font-weight: 400;">Applications for Scott Logic’s 2016 graduate programme and </span><a href="http://www.scottlogic.com/careers/internship/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">internships</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> remain open, and from October this year, we’ll also be taking applications for our 2017 opportunities.

Have you:

 - [ ] Added your blog post to a single category?
 - [ ] Added a brief summary for your post? Summaries should be roughly two sentences in length and give potential readers a good idea of the contents of your post.
 - [ ] Checked that the build passes and spelling errors have been corrected?
 - [ ] Ensured that your author profile contains a profile image (gravatar), and a brief description of yourself? (make it more interesting than just your job title!)

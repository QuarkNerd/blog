summary: The hire standard we hold our testers to
---
Thinking of applying to work with us as a tester? This is a post to help you work out if we are a good fit for you by telling you how we work out if you are a good fit for us.

**Our tester offering–**
Before you apply, we presume you want to know what we offer and the standards we hold ourselves to. We believe in [Passion, Respect, Excellence, Collaboration and Professionalism](https://www.scottlogic.com/who-we-are/)in our dealings with our clients and our colleagues. This is what this looks like for a Scott Logic tester:

Your voice will be heard. Everyone in testing has an equal say in the future of our capability. The ideas of our grads are as important as those of our principle. Any tester can contribute to our [public blog] http://blog.scottlogic.com/category/test.html

You will have room to shape your role. You can get involved with several other streams of work that will develop you personally and professionally - working on our diversity policy, mentoring others, helping shape grad training, interviewing prospective joiners, setting up company get-togethers and representing Scott Logic at testing events.

You will be immersed in a learning culture. Different offices have have tekkie brekkies (with a free hot breakfast!) brown bag learning lunches, learn by example mentoring and pair programming sessions. We offer all our testers someone to check-in with for their client work and a coach to help them professionally develop.

We wholeheartedly encourage external collaboration. We pay for you to get out there and see how other people are testing. This year alone, we have testers attending The [National software testing conference](http://www.softwaretestingconference.com/), [Women of Silicon Roundabout](http://www.women-in-technology.com) and multiple Testbash events.  We are proud to be one of the [Testbash](https://dojo.ministryoftesting.com/events) sponsors.

You will be surrounded by very smart peers to guide you. Our standards for hiring are high, not just in testing but across the board. Our developers, BAs, UX designers, project managers and architects are all smart engaged people who are there to help and support anyone in the business who needs it. If you are stuck, just let your colleagues know and be prepared for a deluge of help from all perspectives.

**The recruitment path–**
We want to set our testers up for success in every possible way. The beginning of that journey is hiring people who have the right mindset and attitude to enjoy the work we do and get on well with the rest of the company. We don’t hire to put posteriors on perches. We hire bright, passionate people and our talented client management team find them great roles with interesting clients.

In the testing practice, we look at two things to access how a person will thrive within Scott Logic. Those two things are the candidate and ourselves. Sounds blazingly simple, doesn’t it? To make it this simple, we have spent many hours analysing and understanding the personality types that thrive in Scott Logic, how to recruit them and how to retain them.

Our interviews are an exercise in observation and interaction with the candidate to draw out their personality as much as possible. This is because we are interested in them as a person first and foremost. It is a person’s character and attitude that make them a great tester and a great team member.

**Looking at the person –**
We want technologically inclined people with a deep, wide unabashed curiosity (mixed with a bit of healthy cynicism) for assumptions they are presented with. We want social people who are honest and respectful of everyone they engage with.

**In looking at the person, we consider –**
What motivates them? What makes them happy? What do they take pride in? How do they react to the unfamiliar? What do they want to upskill themselves in? Are they the loudest or the quietest person in the room (or somewhere in between)?

**Looking at the person as a tester –**
We want people who are test infected, passionate advocates of the work they do and how they do it. We want people who are happy to embrace new ways of working and technologies.

**In looking at the person as a tester, we consider –**
How do they show their passion for testing? How do they learn and teach others? What sort of role would make them happy? Do they evangelise a particular way of testing? Where do they want to get to in their testing career?

**Looking at the person as a team member –**
Modern testers have to be social creatures as they can be the nexus of a delivery team who playing a number of roles. They can be 1 of the 3 amigos, the trusted adviser for an automation solution, interviewing and observing end users, building out teams, educating and informing managers (who may be looking for process heavy deliverables from Agile teams who want to work at pace) In some cases, the tester has to be all of the above.

**In looking at the person as a team member, we consider -**
What sort of team do they like best? How do they solve problems in the software development lifecycle? Do they have a thirst for innovation? How do they deal with challenging personalities?

**Looking at ourselves -**
The scrutiny we put our candidates under is balanced by a phase of introspection on our part to ensure that we can offer the applicant what they want from their workplace.

Can we give this person the environment and role they want? Do we share the same values? Are they interested in us and able to articulate why? Would we be happy to go on a client site with this person by our side? Would we be happy to embed this person as the trusted advisor for testing within a client team? Are they a decent person that we would happily spend 3 hours trapped in a lift with?

**Here is what we don’t do -**
We do not play keyword bingo on a candidate’s CV.
Scanning for keywords does not inform anyone what a candidate is capable of. There is no point in sending us CVs that have lists of operating systems, apps, tools and courses. It's useful if you have worked on every operating system since Millennium, Debian 2.2 and Mac OSX but it's a better use of the space to tell us about your attitude, the changes you have driven, how you learn and how awesome and likable you are.

We do not have CV reviews by people who don't understand testing.
We have a technical recruitment team who know exactly what we are looking for in candidates and we are in close contact with them to make sure they understand what sort of testers we are looking for. Once they pass a CV on, it goes to the testers in the office you are applying to for review. This means all applications are reviewed by people who read and re-read your application in great detail and understand what a great tester looks like. You just have to help us to find [YOU](https://www.scottlogic.com/careers/job-family-testing)

**Last of all –**
Have you been offered an interview? Well done! Now come prepared to interview _US_. You have obviously impressed the development team as we want to talk to you. Make the most of this and come armed with questions from doing your research. If you have a list of requirements for your next role, bring that too, we would love to see it and tell you how we match up. Remember, every potential employer you talk to has an obligation to make the interview experience a good one and to impress you too!

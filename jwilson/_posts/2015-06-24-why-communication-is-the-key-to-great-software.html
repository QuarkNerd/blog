You might think they wouldn’t be top of the list for a software development firm, so we asked some of our team to explain why good communication is an indispensable skill at Scott Logic, regardless of job title.<!--more--><br></span><h2 dir="ltr">For a Developer...</h2><p dir="ltr">A common model is for members of a group to work individually on separate features, and merge their work at regular intervals. Whilst this model does allow parallel work, its results pale compared to those of a team that constantly collaborates. Pair programming sessions, shared design and swarming on tasks allow much greater gains than a parallel working model, but these techniques also rely on communication skills for excellence to be achieved.  <br><br><strong>David, Senior Developer</strong><br><br></p><h2>For a UX Designer...</h2><p dir="ltr"><strong>Rui, UX Designer</strong><br><br></p><h2>For a Tester...</h2><p dir="ltr"><strong>Daniel, Lead Tester</strong><br><br></p><h2>For a project manager...</h2><p dir="ltr">Communication skills are both written and verbal. With respect to project governance, written communication skills are paramount in effectively communicating progress and any risks identified, usually through a weekly status report. Verbal communication skills are essential in allowing the project manager to build effective relationships based on trust and respect, with both project stakeholders and development teams alike. Finally let’s not forget the ability to listen and understand the meaning behind the words, from a project sponsor conveying the organisation’s vision, to a developer explaining a technical task in detail to help inform a decision-maker.<br><br><strong>Paul, Project Manager<br><br><br></strong><span id="docs-internal-guid-8ba36110-1bb1-1857-330d-463e8f30afec">It can be easy to think of communication skills as more relevant to certain lines of work than others. However, as expressed by our team members above, collaboration is vital to all roles at Scott Logic, and key to successful collaboration is effective communication.</span><strong><br></strong></p><div><span> </span></div>

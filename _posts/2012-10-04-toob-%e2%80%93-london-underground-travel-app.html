<p>I have recently been working on an application called Toob as an entry for CodeProject&#8217;s <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/script/Awards/competition.aspx?cid=598">App Innovation Contest</a>.  It is a London Underground travel app for Windows 8 that will be released to the Windows Store in due course.  It is currently a work in progress but I have written an <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/script/Articles/ArticleVersion.aspx?waid=40124&#038;aid=470645" >article</a> introducing the application and going through some useful technical information for anyone interested in writing HTML5 applications for Windows 8.  It is primarily a technical article, but I plan to write up some thoughts about the Windows 8 user experience and designing for Windows 8 in due course.  For those of you who can&#8217;t wait, here is a sneak preview of my opinion: the Windows 8 user experience is as Frankenstein-ish as you&#8217;d expect from its dual-experience nature; it is both truly delightful and painfully awkward.</p>

<p><em>Chris Grant discusses the ins-and-outs of the MVVM architectural pattern in his recent CodeProject article.</em></p>
<p>Chris Grant has published his first article on CodeProject, describing the development of <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/silverlight/SilverTrack.aspx">SilverTrack</a>, a Silverlight application, using <a href="http://www.visiblox.com/">Visiblox charts</a>, for plotting telemetry data.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.scottlogic.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/silvertrack.png"></a><a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/silverlight/SilverTrack.aspx"><img class="center" style="display: block;" src="http://www.scottlogic.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/silvertrack.png" alt="" width="350" height="321" /></a>In this article Chris discusses the ins-and-outs of the Model-View-ViewModel architectural pattern and how he applied it to create this visually compelling application.</p>
<p>This article also covers other aspect of Silverlight development, including the creation of custom controls and the creation of custom behaviours for the Visiblox charts. Initial feedback for the article has been very good!</p>

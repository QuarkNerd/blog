<p>A couple of days ago I was happy to hear that I am a prizewinner in the <a href="http://www.community-credit.com">Community Credit awards</a> for November 2008. Community Credit encourages developers to contribute to the global developer community by writing articles, giving talks, participating on forums etc... Top contributors are rewarded with 'stupid prizes',  I will shortly be receiving my certificate and some Wasabi flavoured gumballs:</p>

<p>I have also, just yesterday, been accepted into the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/wpf-disciples/">WPF Disciples Group</a>. A small group of WPF enthusiasts who 'move the world forward' - a grand and noble tagline!</p>
<p>Regards, Colin E.</p>

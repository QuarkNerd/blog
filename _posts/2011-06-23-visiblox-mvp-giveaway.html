<p>Readers of my blog will probably have noticed that I have a keen interest in both charting and performance. My friends over at <a href="http://www.visiblox.com/">Visiblox</a> have combined these both to create what is one of the fastest charts for WPF, Silverlight and Windows Phone 7, see my <a href="http://www.scottlogic.co.uk/blog/colin/2010/12/visiblox-visifire-dynamicdatadisplay-charting-performance-comparison/">recent benchmark blog post for details</a>. What's more, this performance has been achieved without sacrificing API clarity; the Visiblox charts can be instantiated with concise and clean  XAML or manipulated from code-behind. </p>
<p>The guys at Visiblox told me that they are giving away free licences for their charting products to anyone who is a current Microsoft MVP, so I thought I'd share that with you in case you're interested.  For more details on this offer please <a href="http://www.visiblox.com/feedback">contact Visiblox directly</a>.</p>

<p>If you are an MVP, give these charts a whirl ... </p>
<p>I'd better get back to work on the cross-platform (WPF, Silverlight, WP7) application that I will be demoing at the next <a href="http://consultingblogs.emc.com/markmann/archive/2011/06/07/silverlight-uk-user-group-june-2011-agenda.aspx">Silverlight UK User Group meeting</a>, and yes, it uses Visiblox charts!</p>
<p>Regards, Colin E.</p>

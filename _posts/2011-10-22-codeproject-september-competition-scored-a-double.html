<p>I have just received an email from Codeproject - my article on <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/windows-phone-7/XAMLFinance.aspx">XAMLFinance, a cross platform Silverlight, WPF and WP7</a> application, has won Best C# and Best Overall article competitions for September.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/windows-phone-7/XAMLFinance.aspx"><img src="http://www.scottlogic.co.uk/blog/colin/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/codeproject.gif" alt="" title="codeproject" width="225" height="72" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-283" /></a></p>
<p>Having narrowly missed out in the monthly competitions a few times, I am pleased to have scored a double this time round! Thanks to all who voted.</p>
<p>Regards, Colin E.</p>

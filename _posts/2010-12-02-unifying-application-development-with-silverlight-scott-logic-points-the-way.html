<p>Colin took us through the history of development across these three form factors and showed how Silverlight and WPF provide one of the first opportunities within the IT organisation to achieve realistic skills and code re-use across all three.  Colin put his money where his mouth was by demonstrating a simple financial application with over 75% common code running as a standalone app, in the browser and on a Windows Phone 7 device. </p>
<p>Also appearing on the bill were <strong>Microsoft's leadership team for Development Platform Evangelism, Mark Taylor and Marc Holmes</strong>.  Marc took the audience through Microsoft's view on the debate around Silverlight vs Flash vs HTML5 and what "the cloud" is likely to mean in practice for the enterprise. </p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/archive/2010/10/IMG_1736.jpg" alt="Silverlight And WPF" width="300" height="200" class="image_float_right" />The Q&amp;A sparked some lively debate on subjects as varied as iTunes, how usable XAML actually is to the average developer and the future shape of the mobile computing market.  Over post-seminar drinks at Microsoft's office in Waverley Gate, delegate feedback was hugely positive with many expressing an interest in the next event. Watch this space!</p>

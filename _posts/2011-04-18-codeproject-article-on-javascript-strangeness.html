<p>At the weekend I published a CodeProject article titled "A Collection of JavaScript Gotchas".  The target audience is  JavaScript developers and also any other developer who might have an interest in JavaScript.   I think it covers pretty much all of the wacky features that give JavaScript a bad name.</p>

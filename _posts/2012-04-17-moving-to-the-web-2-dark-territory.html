I say impossible because the web is such a vast topic. On one side sits stacks of bizarre and nuanced APIs, but on the other mountains of really useful resources and frameworks that help smooth over the cracks. I can't hope to cover even a small fraction of what exists, so I apologise now if your framework/resource of choice is missing. I've simply tried to give an ordered list of concepts to work through, in a way that I think I would find useful if I was first starting out on the web.</em></p>
<h2 style="clear: both;">Debugging</h2>
<p>If you've had any experience of JavaScript development before it's likely that along the way you've used the window method alert to aid your debugging. It's a blocking call which shows a dialog box containing some static text and an OK button which the user must click. The blocking nature of the call is as much a blessing as a curse depending on what you were trying to debug, and being restricted to static text at some point invariably means writing a custom object formatter. But by far the biggest annoyance of this method is if you accidentally leave one in a loop!</p>

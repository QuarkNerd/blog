<p>Scott Logic Running Club has entered two teams in the 2010 Edinburgh Marathon Hairy Haggis Team Relay which takes place on the 23 May. The Team Relay is run at the same time and along the same course as the Marathon, with the distance being split between runners in teams of four and the longest running leg being about eight miles.</p>
<p>We have entered a team from each of our principal development centres in Newcastle and Edinburgh, with our London office preferring to watch the race on the TV instead. To the best of our knowledge we are the only SME based in the North East of England and Scotland to field two teams in this prestigious event.</p>
<p>Though the early season training has been hampered initially by the snow and ice, as the weather warms and the days get longer, excuses for not training become more limited both in quantity and quality. Finally being able to navigate around Town Moor by something other than GPS is certainly helpful!</p>
<p>We have not set any particular time or finishing position expectations for the race, though completing the distance is of course considered a must, and we expect at least a moderate amount of friendly inter-team rivalry. Most of us are eagerly anticipating not only the race, but also the opportunity for essential post-race hydration in a conveniently situated hostelry afterwards. May the best team on the day win!</p>

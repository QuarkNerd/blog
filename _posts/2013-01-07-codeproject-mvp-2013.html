<p>Earlier today I received an email informing me that I have been awarded a CodeProject MVP for the year 2013.  I am very grateful to CodeProject for this award &#8211; it is a very popular website for developers, with around 10 million members, and thousands of authors. It is an honour to be among the company of the <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/script/Awards/MVPWinners.aspx">~30 other MVPs</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.codeproject.com/"><img src="http://www.scottlogic.co.uk/blog/colin/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/codeproject.gif" alt="codeproject" width="225" height="72" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-283" /></a></p>
<p>This year I have contributed five articles to Codeproject:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/365120/KnockoutJS-vs-Silverlight">KnockoutJS vs. Silverlight</a> &#8211; An article that helps people transition from Silverlight to Knockout and JavaScript.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/342715/Plotting-Circular-Relationship-Graphs-with-Silverl">Plotting Circular Relationship Graphs with Silverlight</a> &#8211; An article that I wrote on my travels to Denmark, a bit of fun with data visualisation.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/428088/A-Gesture-Driven-Windows-Phone-To-Do-List">A Gesture-Driven Windows Phone To-Do List</a> &#8211; which describes how to create a to-do list application which is controlled via multi-touch gestures. This article won the <em>&#8220;Best Mobile article of July 2012&#8243;</em> award.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/445361/Property-Finder-a-Cross-Platform-HTML5-Mobile-App">Property Finder &#8211; a Cross-Platform HTML5 Mobile App</a> &#8211; which was an article about the use of HTML5 for cross-platform development, this was the &#8216;seed&#8217; for the <a href="http://www.propertycross.com">PropertyCross</a> project</li>
<li><a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/473582/Clearer-A-Gesture-Driven-Windows-8-To-Do-Applicati">Clearer - A Gesture-Driven Windows 8 To-Do Application</a> &#8211; which was basically my attempt to win an Ultrabook by re-hashing my earlier Windows Phone article &#8230; which worked <img src='http://www.scottlogic.co.uk/blog/colin/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </li>
</ul>
<p>That&#8217;s one more article than I contributed the previous year!</p>
<p>Over the past year my development interests have diversified, in 2011 I was mainly focused on WPF, Silverlight and Windows Phone. I now find myself spending just as much time on JavaScript and iOS &#8211; neither of which are really the core focus for CodeProject. I will probably be writing for <a href="http://www.raywenderlich.com/">Ray Wenderlich&#8217;s iOS</a> site just as much as CodeProject throughout 2013, however, I doubt I will ever give up on CodeProject. It has such a lively community, attracts some of the best technical authors, and provides them with a great environment to work within.</p>
<p>Regards, Colin E.</p>

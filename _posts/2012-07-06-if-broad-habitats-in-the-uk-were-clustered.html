<p>Intrigued by Mark Easton&#8217;s question on Twitter, <a href="http://twitter.com/BBCMarkEaston/status/218289686597210112" >&#8220;How much of Britain is built on?&#8221;</a>, and inspired the associated article, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-18623096" >The great urban myth of Britain</a>, I wanted to put the <a href="http://uknea.unep-wcmc.org/" >UK NEA</a>&#8216;s statement that &#8220;6.8% of the UK&#8217;s land area is now classified as urban&#8221; into some kind of context that actually made sense to me.</p>
<p>The obvious answer is that 6.8% of the UK is just short of 2 million football pitches.  Unfortunately, this is still not actually something I can remotely picture (much like <a href="http://johnfinnemore.blogspot.co.uk/2008/05/i-am-supposed-to-be-writing-sitcom.html" >genuinely imagining more than 10 otters is a tall order</a>).  The best solution I could come up with was to put the information in the context of actual geography:</p>
<p><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/archive/2012/07/uk_habitats.png"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/archive/2012/07/uk_habitats.png" alt="If broad habitats in the UK were clustered..." title="UK Habitats" width="100%" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-719" /></a></p>
<p>And here is the original report from which the numbers were sourced, for posterity: <a href='{{ site.baseurl }}/archive/2012/07/28_06_12_uk_national_ecosystem.pdf'>UK National Ecosystem Assessment</a>.</p>
<p><b>UPDATE</b>: I have written a short <a href="http://www.scottlogic.co.uk/blog/graham/2012/07/pretty-pictures/">critique of this graphic</a> that also provides some insight into how it was created and the figures behind it.</p>

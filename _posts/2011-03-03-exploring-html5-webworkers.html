<p>The WebWorkers API is a draft HTML5 specification for running JavaScript in the background. It is one of a number of new HTML5 features that are desireable for developers of web applications.</p>
<p>In this four-part series, Scott Logic developer, Jonathan Cardy, takes a detailed look at the WebWorkers API and puts it through its paces.</p>
<p>In the <a href="http://www.scottlogic.co.uk/2011/02/web-workers-part-1-performance/">first blog post</a>, Jonathan looks at the performance of WebWorkers across all the major browsers, in the<a href="http://www.scottlogic.co.uk/2011/02/web-workers-part-2-using-jquery-deferred/"> second blog post</a>, Jonathan looks at how WebWorkers can be combined with the new jQuery Deferred plugin, creating a concise and fluent syntax. In the<a href="http://www.scottlogic.co.uk/2011/02/web-workers-part-3-creating-a-generic-worker/"> third post</a> WebWorkers are created without the need to add the to a separate JavaScript file, and finally, the <a href="http://www.scottlogic.co.uk/2011/02/web-workers-part-4-wrapping-it-up/">fourth post</a> re-visits jQuery, coordinating WebWorkers via fork and join.</p>

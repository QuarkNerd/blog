<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
<p>You can build feature-rich apps with HTML5, but should you?  To help answer this question, we used HTML5 to develop a tablet app called Wealth Manager.</p>
<p>Delivering the required functionality with HTML5 was easy, but it was much harder to achieve the level of visual flair users have come to expect from native apps.  Our initial intent was to produce a uniform cross-platform experience, but eventually we were forced to make some platform-specific compromises.</p>

<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>Tablets have fundamentally changed the way financial advisors work with their clients, providing immediate access to financial analysis and reference material.  We thought that this made a wealth management tablet app a good choice for our investigation.</p>
<p>Our Wealth Manager app was designed specifically for the tablet form factor, rather than other form factors such as smartphone, web or desktop.  Even so, the variety of tablet platforms (iOS, Android, etc) means that creating native applications for each platform can represent a significant development cost.  HTML5 has the potential to allow a single application code-base to run on all platforms, but what compromises does this choice entail?</p>

<h3>Platform Comparison</h3>
<p>In the following video we present our observations on how the same app performs on two platforms.  For this demonstration we're using a Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 running Android 3.1 and an iPad 2 running iOS5.  Both devices are running a PhoneGap-wrapped version of the app.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Wealth Manager shows that it is possible to create fully functional cross-platform tablet apps using HTML5 and PhoneGap.  However, some tablets currently lack the power to exploit these technologies fully, meaning immersive effects such as animation may be impractical, and consequently apps developed using these technologies often lack the flair of native apps across all devices.</p>
<p>We have seen that compromises may have to be made with the user experience on some tablets. The nature and number of the compromises needed will depend on the complexity of your app, and the question you will have to ask yourself is whether their effect on your app will be so great that it will damage your brand.  Scott Logic would, of course, be happy to help you answer that question!</p>

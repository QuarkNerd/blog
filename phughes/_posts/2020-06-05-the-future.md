  The future is not what it used to be.

  Those organisations who emerged stronger and more competitive from the 2008 global financial crisis are at it again. They have benefited significantly from past bold and decisive moves and now they are wasting no time adapting to the next version of the future. So what are the tenets of change this time?

## The Post Pandemic Context
There isn’t a sector, business or government which has not been impacted in both the near term and long term by the Covid-19 (C19) pandemic. Some will adapt to survive, but many including some famous brands like Hertz Car Rental, will not emerge from this downturn. 
This pandemic paralysis has provided (for some) a sudden glimpse into a future world, one in which digital has become central to every interaction, forcing organisations and individuals further up the adoption curve almost overnight. A world in which digital channels become the main (and in some cases the only) customer engagement model, automated processes become a primary driver of productivity and the very basis of flexible, transparent and stable supply chains. It is a world in which agile ways of working are a prerequisite to survival and meeting seemingly daily changes of customer behavior. 

## Performance of leaders and laggards in a crisis
The economic outlook following this C19 crisis, may be worse than the financial crisis of 2008 and is forcing CEOs to make some difficult decisions. Some are pulling in, making cuts and applying a mentality of simply riding out the storm. Others however, are taking bold decisive action to make sure that when the pandemic subsides, they will be stronger going forward and will get ahead of the competition. Those leaders acting with a “through-cycle” mindset will be best positioned to accelerate out of the economically challenging times ahead. 
In the financial crisis of 2008 the top quintile of companies was ahead of their peers by about 20 percentage points as they moved into recovery in terms of cumulative total returns to shareholders (TRS). Eight years later their lead had grown to more than 150 percentage points. One key lesson from that experience is the companies that move early and decisively in a crisis do best in the medium to long term.


## Leading Post Pandemic Business Models
Future “best in class” business organisations will be characterised by their systemic agility and flexibility to reconfigure at speed and scale. On the one hand, reconfiguration will be driven by the needs and behaviours of customers, suppliers, employees, markets, regulators and leadership. On the other, agility will be measured in terms of secure collaboration, execution and delivery regardless of location, user device, time of day and access to enterprise data/ systems.
Organisations will not have to wait until the next crisis to access and exploit the value of their agility and flexibility investments. In addition to responding to change at greater speed, several new aspects of business will be part of the “new normal”.
Contact Free Economy: Whilst already underway before the C19 pandemic, there has been a huge acceleration in all activities online including commerce, medical consultations and full automation of other interactions and activities.
Self Service Employment: Internal facing enterprise systems and data requirements will become totally self service leaving internal non core functions free to participate as a strategic adviser to the business.
Public sector involvement in the private sector: There will be more interventions in business either financially or from new regulation.
Resilience to economic shock: Much greater scrutiny of an organisation’s resilience will be assessed by their investors, stakeholders and possibly statutory auditors.
Capital reallocation: Any capital resources which do not support the value of flexibility and agility are likely to be reassessed. Such items include data centres, office capacity, private networks, software & systems investments.

## The key technical tenets of flexibility and agility.
There is no “silver bullet” to achieve these new levels of agility and flexibility at speed and scale, but there is an overall design mentality which should be applied. The fundamental design principles of the Internet were to support communication and collaboration even in times of nuclear conflict. Forty years on, modern web technologies and standards have dramatically expanded the functionality of the Global Internet making it the centre of commerce. 
Some of the key technology tenets of business flexibility and agility are obvious. In themselves they are well known and their development is relentless, but it's their aligned simultaneous implementation in the future which will distinguish their total value from their siloed implementations of the past. These tenets include;
Cloud (dynamic scale and new economics); With complete automation, allow an enterprise to securely provision infrastructure, platforms and software as a service regardless of scale and with supply/ demand economics.
Modern web technologies (Vendor agnostic, ubiquitous use); To build and provision applications for the web and enterprise (including desktop) which are device agnostic and the basis of application programming design.
Desktop Containers; (Leveraging the value of legacy); A capability (emerging from the financial sector) to allow modern web technologies to integrate with legacy desktop applications (e.g. client server) in a controlled and phased move to the web as an overall strategy 
Application Programming Interfaces or APIs to shield your investments from proprietary lock in, to avoid creating the next redundancy legacy and support agile teamwork in software development.

## How to get started, what is your current digital capability
At Scott Logic, we are already working with leaders who are taking such bold steps to get ahead in their own markets and emerge from the C19 pandemic in a much stronger position relative to their competition. Many of these organisations did the same in the last global crisis of 2008.
The question we are asked by most leaders is “where to start”. To answer this fundamental question, we have developed our own capability review process, usually a four week engagement to look at all aspects of your current digital capability and assess your enablers and blockers. The deliverables include an executive summary, detailed findings and detailed recommendations.

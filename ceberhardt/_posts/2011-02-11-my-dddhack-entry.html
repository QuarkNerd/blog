<p>At the weekend my wife was having a 'girls night out', which gave me an excellent excuse (and roughly four hours) to spend working on a <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ukmsdn/archive/2011/01/29/dddhack-competition-at-ddd9.aspx">DDDHack</a> entry. I selected the RSSReader project as a starting point with the aim of turning it into something which resembled a more usable application. The changes I made are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Upgrade code from the April CTP tools!
<li>Render each RSS entry using the <code>WebBrowser</code> control.
<li>Add a 'read' state to each entry so that you can see which ones you have already read.
<li>Forward / back navigation controls to allow easier browsing of a feed.
<li>An indicator of the number of items read for each feed.
<li>Mark all as read / unread menu items
<li>Favourites
<li>A pivot-based front page.
<li>Send story as SMS (which fails if you hit the back-button due to a lack of tombstoning!)</ul>
<p>Here's a video of the application in action:</p>

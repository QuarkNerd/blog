title: Our most popular Tech Blog posts of 2016
---

<p>OK, so I’m a bit late; it was my intention to write this post at the start of January. However I’ve been a bit busy…which is a good thing!</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the start of 2016 I </span><a href="//smarter.scottlogic.com/insights/most-popular-tech-blog-posts-of-2015"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wrote a brief post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that shared the most popular topics on our technical blog from the previous year, and here I am to repeat the exercise. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Firstly, the number of visitors to our site has continued to increase. Towards the end of 2015 we exceeded 100,000 visitors per month for the first time; throughout 2016 visits have continued to grow, pushing towards 120,000 per month.</span></p><h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strength in numbers</span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking at some of the other metrics, in 2016 we published:</span></p><ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">80 blog posts (+12 compared to 2015)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">By 32 different authors (+4 compared to 2015)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Including 18 new authors.</span></li>
</ul><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While it's great to see an increase in the overall number of blog posts and visitors, I’m most pleased with the number of new authors we’ve attracted.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking back on 2016 the five most popular blog posts (with visit counts suitably corrected based on the date they were published) were:</span></p><ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://blog.scottlogic.com/2016/01/20/restful-api-with-aspnet50.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building a Restful API with ASP.NET 5</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - In this post, Nick Soper walks through the process of creating a REST API with ASP.NET 5 (now ASP.NET Core 1.0). This was a very successful post which continues to attract large volumes of traffic, showing that practical posts with clear and simple instructions are very valuable </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://blog.scottlogic.com/2016/09/05/hosting-netcore-on-linux-with-docker.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hosting .NET Core on Linux with Docker</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Another one from Nick Soper, this time building on the previous post to demonstrate deployment through Docker</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://blog.scottlogic.com/2016/11/01/go-particle-simulation.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating a Simple Particle Simulation with Go</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Here Will Ferguson shares his experience of learning a new language</span></li>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://blog.scottlogic.com/2016/06/13/code-reuse-in-microservices-architecture.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Code Re-use in Microservice Architecture with Spring Boot</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Last but not least, this post from Bartosz Jedrzejewski explores code re-use within microservices. Another of his posts, </span><a href="http://blog.scottlogic.com/2016/01/05/java-microservices-with-dropwizard-tutorial.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Java Microservices with Dropwizard</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, narrowly missed out on a top five slot.</span></li>
</ul><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s great to see such a diverse range of topics being covered on the blog, a trend I’m sure will continue throughout 2017. Happy New Year!</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regards, Colin E.</span></p>

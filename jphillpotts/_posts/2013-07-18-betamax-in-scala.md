  <a href="http://betamax.software">Betamax</a> is a tool to help with testing 

  applications that consume web services by allowing the developer to record

  Scala.

I first saw [Betamax](http://betamax.software) a couple of years ago when Rob
Fletcher created it. More recently, I read about it being used with Scala in a
[blog post by Rob Slifka at Sharethrough](http://www.sharethrough.com/2013/07/integration-testing-http-requests-with-scala-and-betamax/),
which got me thinking about how we might tidy up using it in various Scala test
frameworks.

Betamax is originally written in Groovy, but as a JVM language, its compiled classes
can be used with any application written in a JVM language. Its simplest use is in a
[JUnit](http://junit.org/) test, or any test framework that supports features of the
JUnit API, e.g. [Spock](https://code.google.com/p/spock/). However, for whatever reason,
JUnit hasn't really gained as much traction in Scala as other test frameworks, with users
often preferring to use [ScalaTest](http://www.scalatest.org/) or
[specs2](http://etorreborre.github.io/specs2/).

## JUnit in Scala

Let's take a look at a simple Java example using JUnit first (ruthlessly pinched from the
Betamax homepage):

{% gist 6029082 MyTest.java %}

What this is doing is registering a `Recorder` as a JUnit `@Rule` - this is a JUnit
feature that basically registers the instance as an object that's going to interact with
each test, in this case a `MethodRule` that interacts with each test, rather than the
class as a whole. JUnit will call the implemented `MethodRule.apply` method on the rule
object before each test is run. The Betamax recorder then checks the test method that is
about to be run to see whether it has a `@Betamax` annotation, and if so, handles the
test using the specified tape name.

Well that seems pretty simple, doesn't it, so let's try the same thing in a Scala JUnit
test (I'm using the [OpenWeatherMap API](http://openweathermap.org/API) as a simple XML
webservice - you can see the source
[here](http://gist.github.com/6029082#file-WeatherClient-scala)):

{% gist 6029082 WeatherTest.scala %}

At first glance, this seems simple enough - we can pack up and go home. Unfortunately,
when we try and run this test we get an error from JUnit saying that an object with a
`@Rule` annotation must be public. Obviously there's something odd about the way Scala
processes annotations on a value (all values are public unless declared otherwise), or
the value itself, that JUnit's reflection can't pick it up. Fortunately, a change was
made in JUnit for this very problem, and we can instead annotate a function that returns
the value:

{% gist 6029082 annotated-function.scala %}

JUnit is happy with this, but when we run the test the Betamax recorder still doesn't
get used. It turns out this is because of a
[bug](https://github.com/junit-team/junit/issues/589) with methods annotated with `@Rule`
that return a `MethodRule` - hopefully this will get fixed, and then JUnit + Betamax
should work fine.

## specs2

So now let's look at the library that Rob Slifka was having problems with - specs2. If
you read Rob's [blog post](http://www.sharethrough.com/2013/07/integration-testing-http-requests-with-scala-and-betamax/)
you'll remember that he had a test that is fetching JSON from Twitter:

{% gist 6029082 specs2-spec.scala %}

To use Betamax around his `var tw = Twitter(url)` he ended up with a helper function:

{% gist 6029082 specs2-helper.scala %}

He could then use the helper in the middle of his test:

{% gist 6029082 specs2-using-helper.scala %}

This works fine, but for me it's a bit distracting in the middle of the test to have
the `BetamaxHelper` getting involved. Also, using `null` in Scala is a bit of a code
smell if you ask me, so I thought I'd see if we could do it in a slightly tidier way.

Here's my simple specs2 test:

{% gist 6029082 WeatherSpec.scala %}

One thing to notice about specs2 tests is that there are no explicit function
definitions, so there's nowhere to put our `@Betamax` annotation - I believe this was
the reason for Rob's findings in the last paragraph of *The Journey* in his blog. The
reason for there being no function to annotate is because, for the sake of
readability, the tests are just created on construction by having an implicit
function that turns your string into a test fragment and allows you to join it to
other fragments using functions like `should` and `in`. The test fragments are then
filtered and run after the class has been initialised (and your code has been stored
as a partially applied function for execution when needed).

Looking through the specs2 documentation we discover that there's a trait for wrapping around a test specification, `Around`.
We can implement that to do the Betamax jiggery-pokery without interfering with the
readability of the test:

{% gist 6029082 Specs2Betamax.scala %}

We can then use this in our test spec:

{% gist 6029082 specs2-using-around.scala %}

I think this looks a bit tidier, and closer to the Betamax examples using annotations.
However, there is one small disadvantage of doing it this way - having the `Around`
implementation in the companion object with the body wrapped in a synchronized
statement means that tests can be run in parallel, but it means that the whole test
runs in parallel rather than just the section of the test that's actually doing the
HTTP request. For me, that's a price worth paying (at least you can still run all your
non-HTTP tests in parallel) in return for more readable tests, but I'll admit it's a
matter of personal preference.

## ScalaTest

Now onto our last test framework. Here's a simple ScalaTest test:

{% gist 6029082 SimpleWeatherSuite.scala %}

As with specs2, we see that ScalaTest has gone down a similar route of not using
explicit function definitions for defining tests, and instead using the `test`
function to allow a partially applied anonymous function that implements the test
to be stored against a test name string.

Unfortunately, I couldn't find any way to hook into the test specification. What I
would have liked is to be able to do something like:

{% gist 6029082 scalatest-ideal.scala %}

I just couldn't work out a way to get this to work - I'd be very happy for someone
to point me in the right direction. Anyway, instead I implemented a `Betamax` trait
that allows me to use a `testWithBetamax` function:

{% gist 6029082 ScalaTestBetamax.scala %}

This allows us to use Betamax in our test as follows:

{% gist 6029082 WeatherSuite.scala %}

## Conclusion

So there we go, using Betamax to record and replay HTTP requests in Scala tests is
definitely possible, and without having to compromise much in the way of test
readability.

If you'd like the full source code that I worked on, it's available
[on GitHub](https://github.com/mrpotes/betamax-scala).

# Update

I just couldn't leave the ScalaTest example like that - it just wasn't readable
enough for me. You'll remember that my ideal usage would look like this:

{% gist 6029082 scalatest-ideal.scala %}

The first problem with this is that the `with` keyword is reserved in Scala - it's
how you add extra traits beyond the one that's being extended - so instead let's
use the word `using`.

The next problem is that we need to insert our code between the first and second
parameter list to the `test` method. We can do this using a partially applied
function, by adding `_` after the first parameter list, so our test declaration
now needs to look something like:

{% gist 6029082 improved-scalatest-decl.scala %}

Now the problem we have is that there's no such method as `using` on a function.
We need to transform it into an object that *does* have a using function - a trait
with an implicit conversion should do the trick:

{% gist 6029082 Wrapped.scala %}

We've now created the ability to insert any extra function we like between the
`test` function's two parameter lists - indeed this trait could be used to add all
sorts of different resources around a ScalaTest suite, and should work equally well
with **Should-In** and **Given-When-Then** ScalaTest language.

All that remains to do now is to implement the `Betamax` trait to allow us to use
the `betamax` "keyword":

{% gist 6029082 ImprovedScalaTestBetamax.scala %}

Simple! And finally, our test looks like:

{% gist 6029082 ImprovedWeatherSuite.scala %}

Ah, that's better. I'm happy now :)

Implicit functions are very useful little things - if you look at the Specs2 source,
you'll find them being used liberally all over the place to turn string test names
into rich test fragments, and so on. In this example you could of course also get
rid of the `Some` from the `TapeMode`, by declaring a function with signature
`implicit def optionalTapeMode(t: TapeMode): Option[TapeMode]`.
